# ChatBot-C3
Group project for ECU178

The three functions that I have created 
are in my branch and are in the folder 
called 'myFunctions-Bradley'.

This folder should contain the code for
my functions that I coded and it should
consist of curseCount.txt,cursewordDetector.py,
functionCaller-Vanilla.py,functionCaller.py
manualplaylistCreator.py,manualplaylists.txt.

In the cursewordCounter function I have replaced the
cursewords with the placeholder values of: 1,2,3,4,5,6
,7,8,9.

The difference between functionCaller-Vanilla.py and
functionCaller.py, is that functionCaller-Vanilla.py is
entirely my code and contains no other member's code.
On the other hand, the functionCaller.py contains imports
of members of my groups code and isn't successfully merged
(in this file I have stated where and who's code I am importing)
