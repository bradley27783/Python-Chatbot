# ChatBot-C3
Group project for ECU178

The three functions that I have created 
are in my branch and are in the folder 
called 'myFunctions-Bradley'.

This folder should contain the code for
my functions that I coded and it should
consist of curseCount.txt,cursewordDetector.py,
functionCaller-Vanilla.py,functionCaller.py
manualplaylistCreator.py,manualplaylists.txt.

I do apologise for some of the vulgar text that
are in some of the lists but I felt that this
should be a requirement in the Chatbot, because
we don't want the users being rude or using vulgar
language and this should stop them. The only problem is ,
is that to stop them from doing this I need to be able
to detect what they are saying, hence the list of curse
words.

The difference between functionCaller-Vanilla.py and
functionCaller.py, is that functionCaller-Vanilla.py is
entirely my code and contains no other member's code.
On the other hand, the functionCaller.py contains imports
of members of my groups code and isn't successfully merged
(in this file I have stated where and who's code I am importing)
